# Handwritten Digit Recognition
This project performs Handwritten Digit Recognition using four different algorithms, which are-
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forrest Classifier
3. K-Nearest Neighbours
4. Decision Tree Classifier

For each algorithm, a confusion matrix is also plotted as a heatmap.
