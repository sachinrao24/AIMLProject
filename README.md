# Handwritten Digit Recognition
## This project has been implemented using two different approaches-

### 1. The first approach performs Handwritten Digit Recognition using four different algorithms, which are-
      a. Logistic Regression
      b. Random Forrest Classifier
      c. K-Nearest Neighbours
      d. Decision Tree Classifier

   For each algorithm, a sample data point is visualized along with it's actual and predicted values. 
   
### 2. The second approach employs a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow and can be tested on custom images using the OpenCV module.

The MNIST dataset has been used for both techniques and a sample image has also been provided.
