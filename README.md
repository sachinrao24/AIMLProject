# Handwritten Digit Recognition
This project has been implemented in two ways-

## 1. The first technique performs Handwritten Digit Recognition using four different algorithms, which are-
      a. Logistic Regression
      b. Random Forrest Classifier
      c. K-Nearest Neighbours
      d. Decision Tree Classifier

   For each algorithm, a sample data point is visualized along with it's actual and predicted values. 
   
## 2. The second technique employs Deep Neural Networks using TensorFlow and can be tested on custom images using the OpenCV module.
